              >Warren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930 in Omaha,
              Nebraska</b
            >,as the second of three children and the only son of Leila and
            Congressman Howard Buffett. He began his education at Rose Hill
            Elementary School.Buffett showcased an interest in business and
            investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from
            the Omaha public library at age seven.He worked in his grandfather's
            grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering
            newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among
            other means.Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing
            dated back to his schoolboy days he spent in the customers lounge of
            a regional stock brokerage near his father's own brokerage office.At
            11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself,
            and three for his sister Doris Buffett .At 15, Warren made more than
            $175 monthly delivering Washington Post newspapers. In high school,
            he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre
            farm worked by a tenant farmer.He bought the land when he was 14
            years old with $1,200 of his savings.By the time he finished
            college, Buffett had amassed $9,800 in savings.In 1962, Buffett
            became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January
            1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged
            to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one. Buffett invested
            in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing company,
            Berkshire Hathaway. He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury
            Stanton, the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships
            began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's
            partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid
            $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per
            share. This did not include the value of fixed assets. Buffett took
            control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new
            president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed
            the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile
            business had been his worst trade.He then moved the business into
            the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had
            been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold.
